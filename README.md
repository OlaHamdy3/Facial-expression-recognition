## Facial expression recognition
### Overview
Facial expression is the facial changes that reflects a person’s internal emotional states, intentions and feelings. Humans usually employ different cues to express their emotions, such as facial expressions, hand gestures and voice. Facial expressions represent up to 55% of human-communications while other ways such as oral language are allocated a mere 7% of emotion expression. 
Since then, Facial expression recognition (FER) has become a growing area of research with numerous real-world applications such as mental state identification, lie detection, human behaviour understanding and security.

The goal of this project is to apply deep learning techniques to recognize the key seven human emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutrality.

### Dataset
In this project, the dataset used is Kaggle’s Facial Expression Recognition Challenge dataset. This dataset is representative because of its size, unstructured nature of faces and relatively uniform distribution of the data across the seven main human emotions.
It is splitted into 80% training set, 10% validation set and 10% testing set.
The dataset labels are the seven key emotions:
* Angry
* Disgust
* Fear
* Happy
* Sad
* Surprise
* Neutral
